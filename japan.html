<h1>Japan in World War 2</h1>
    <section>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Japan was the fastest country to industrialize in the 20th century. They had gone from a weak feudal nation controlled by the west, to a fully industrialized and expanding empire in a very short amount of time. They won the Sino-Japapanese war with the Chinese and the Russo-Japanese war with Russia. Japan was now an empire that could fight and win against established military powers in their region. The Great Depression hit them very hard and they needed resources and materials badly to keep growing but their home island had none. The only way for them to keep growing was expansion. On September 18, 1931, the Japanese invaded Manchuria. Munchuria was a resource rich area in northern China. In the next few years, Japan would continue to expand. In 1937 the second Sino-Japanese war officially started and in 1940, Japan invaded French Indochina. This action sparked tension with the U.S. and an oil Embargo was announced. This had cornered the Japanese into war. </p>

  <h3>Start of the War</h3>
  <p>Japan knew that they could never win a long naval conflict with America so the most logical move for them was to eliminate the threat before it even posed a problem.A preemptive strike on America would cripple their fighting power and let the Japanese have free reign in the region. On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked America's naval fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The attack was very successful for the Japanese. They thought that the U.S. could never recover from the damage dealt. Between December 10th and 23rd, Japan invaded the Philippines, Guam, Burma, Borneo, Hong Kong, and Wake Island.</p>

  <h3>Battle of Midway</h3>
  <p>Japan had appeared to be undefeatable onslaught all over the pacific but that all changed at the battle of Midway on June 6, 1942. The decisive battle resulted in 4 Japanese aircraft carriers being sunk. The Japanese were not able to recover from this damage and would remain on the defense for the rest of the war. On August 7th the first landings in Guadalcanal were launched by the U.S. This campaign would show that the man power of the U.S. was far greater than Japans. They could easily replace fallen men and could easily repair or replace destroyed vehicles and equipment. </p>

  <h3>War Crimes</h3>
  <p>
	On October 5th 1943 America attacks Wake island and in January 1944, the U.S. attacks the Marshall islands. Japan was on the decline and the war was turning against their favor. They were losing key bases and experienced men. When an island was going to be captured by their enemy, Japanese soldiers would rather kill themselves than surrender. At Wake island, before fighting broke out, Japanese leaders feared an invasion and executed 98 of their prisoners that were being held for forced labor on the island. This is just one example of the kind of buratility that was being shown to the pioneers that were captured. Prisoners of War were shown no mercy and were starved, beaten, tortured and even killed. These actions were in direct violation of international laws on how POWs were supposed to be treated. The most famous acts of these war crimes was the Bataan Death March. This event was a forced march of POWs that resulted in an estimated 20,000 deaths.</p>

  <h3>The Philippines</h3>
  <p>On October 20, 1944, the campaign to retake the philippines was launched by the U.S. This was lead by Douglas MacAurthor. The campaign lasted up until the very end of the war in August 1945. The campaign was a series of battles from islands that resulted in an American victory. The Japanese lost and estimated 350,000 men in the fight and the wars outcome was almost certain. </p>

  <h3>End of the War</h3>
  <p>
	Just before the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet Union declared war on August 9, 1945. The atomic bombs sealed the fate of the Japanese. They officially surrendered on September 2, 1945. After the war ended, war crime trials took place. These trials resulted in 7 japanese war criminals being executed and 16 war criminals got life in prison.</p>
