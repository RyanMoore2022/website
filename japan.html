      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Japan was the fastest country to industrialize in the 20th century. They had gone from a weak feudal nation controlled by the west, to a fully industrialized and expanding empire in a very short amount of time. They won the Sino-Japapanese war with the Chinese and the Russo-Japanese war with Russia. Japan was now an empire that could fight and win against established military powers in their region. The Great Depression hit them very hard and they needed resources and materials badly to keep growing but their home island had none. The only way for them to keep growing was expansion. On September 18, 1931, the Japanese invaded Manchuria. Munchuria was a resource rich area in northern China. In the next few years, Japan would continue to expand. In 1937 the second Sino-Japanese war officially started and in 1940, Japan invaded French Indochina. This action sparked tension with the U.S. and an oil Embargo was announced. This had cornered the Japanese into war. </p>

  <h3>Start of the War</h3>
  <p>Japan knew that they could never win a long naval conflict with America so the most logical move for them was to eliminate the threat before it even posed a problem.A preemptive strike on America would cripple their fighting power and let the Japanese have free reign in the region. On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked America's naval fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The attack was very successful for the Japanese. They thought that the U.S. could never recover from the damage dealt. Between December 10th and 23rd, Japan invaded the Philippines, Guam, Burma, Borneo, Hong Kong, and Wake Island.</p>

  <h3>Battle of Midway</h3>
  <p>Japan had appeared to be undefeatable onslaught all over the pacific but that all changed at the battle of Midway on June 6, 1942. The decisive battle resulted in 4 Japanese aircraft carriers being sunk. The Japanese were not able to recover from this damage and would remain on the defense for the rest of the war. On August 7th the first landings in Guadalcanal were launched by the U.S. This campaign would show that the man power of the U.S. was far greater than Japans. They could easily replace fallen men and could easily repair or replace destroyed vehicles and equipment. </p>
